RTP PAYLOAD SPECS FOR H264
first byte of a nal unit contials f NRI and   type 
its treated as a payload header
and then nal unit starts 

first byte of each NALU contains its type specifcally  bits 3 through 7. (bit 0 is always off, and bits 1-2 indicate weather is NALU is referenced by another NALU)


RTP PAYLOAD paketizastion mode in RTP H264

   The payload format defines three different basic payload structures.
   A receiver can identify the payload structure by the first byte of
   the RTP packet payload, which co-serves as the RTP payload header
   and, in some cases, as the first byte of the payload.  This byte is
   always structured as a NAL unit header.  The NAL unit type field
   indicates which structure is present.  The possible structures are as
   follows.

   Single NAL Unit Packet: Contains only a single NAL unit in the
   payload.  The NAL header type field is equal to the original NAL unit
   type, i.e., in the range of 1 to 23, inclusive.  Specified in Section
   5.6.

   Aggregation Packet: Packet type used to aggregate multiple NAL units
   into a single RTP payload.  This packet exists in four versions, the
   Single-Time Aggregation Packet type A (STAP-A), the Single-Time
   Aggregation Packet type B (STAP-B), Multi-Time Aggregation Packet
   (MTAP) with 16-bit offset (MTAP16), and Multi-Time Aggregation Packet
   (MTAP) with 24-bit offset (MTAP24).  The NAL unit type numbers
   assigned for STAP-A, STAP-B, MTAP16, and MTAP24 are 24, 25, 26, and
   27, respectively.  Specified in Section 5.7.

   Fragmentation Unit: Used to fragment a single NAL unit over multiple
   RTP packets.  Exists with two versions, FU-A and FU-B, identified
   with the NAL unit type numbers 28 and 29, respectively.  Specified in
   Section 5.8.
